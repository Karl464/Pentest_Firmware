"_An FCC ID is a federal identification for any electronic product that can_ _[oscillate above 9 kHz](https://blog.clevercompliance.io/electrical-product-compliance/do-i-need-fcc-certification/)._

_If a product has a radio frequency it should have an ID. This means all pieces of computer hardware, digital cameras, power adapters, garage door openers, and more have their own ID number._

_These devices undergo testing to make sure they won’t interfere with other radio signals or harm the user in some way. Products that require an FCC ID fall into 2 groups:_

_• Intentional, such as smartphones, are products that must broadcast radio frequency energy to operate._

_• Unintentional, such as digital cameras, are products that can put out radio signals as an accidental result of use, but it’s not a main feature._" - **[Navigating FCC IDs](https://www.petra.com/blog/navigating-fcc-id/)**
