Binwalk allows us to perform analysis of firmware binaries including things such as entropy analysis and file system extraction.

```
binwalk -e firmware.bin         #Extract file system. generate the fiile _firmware.bin.extracted
cd _firmware.bin.extracted      #navigate de extracted filesystem, Do as normal OS fyle system pentest, try to identify code, strings, services, ...
```
