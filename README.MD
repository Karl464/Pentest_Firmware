# Firmware Pentesting

Guideline for firmware App Pen-test execution.

Firmware pen testing does not differ so much from pen-testing OS, Web services, thick/thin clients, or Mobile apps. But requires a direct hardware test and some initial steps for firmware extraction and analysis.

# Testing Steps

1. Research device/components. Ex. Identify FFC ID
2. Get the firmware
   - Look online or get an equivalent device to get the firmware.
   - Use the flash dum extracted
3. Reverse engineering and extract the file system and any component encountered. Ex Binwalk
4. Attempt to run the firmware using tools or some form of emulation method. Ex. Firmadyne or Firmware Analysis toolkit.
5. Excuete stadard pentest activities. Ex OS, web or mobile pentest.

Note: If u have direct access to a device with root privilege u can avoid steps 3 & 4.

# Typical IoT vulnerabilities

-   Serial port expose
-   Insecure authentication mechanism used in the serial ports
-   Ability to dump firmware over JTAG or via flash chips
-   External media/based attacks
-   Power analysis and side channel/based attacks
-   

# Firmware Attacks

-    Ability to modify
-    Insecure signature and integrity checks
-    Hard code data
-    Private certification
-    Fyle system extraction
-    Old and insecure software and protocol
